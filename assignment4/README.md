# Assignment 4

> - For this assignment, I planned to do a food factory that only makes pizza but serving many variations of pizza.
> For example, there would be cheese pizza, pepperoni pizza, mushroom pizza, veggie pizza, and deluxe pizza.
> Each of these variants will come with their own lists of toppings except for cheese pizza.
> For example, pepperoni pizza will come with pepperoni only, mushroom pizza will come with mushroom only.
> Veggie pizza will come with mushroom, onion, pepper, basil, and pineapple.
> Deluxe pizza will come with all of the toppinngs available.
>
> - For creating these variations, I created a Pizza class already to include some of the characteristics of pizza.
> I didn't include all necessary parameters in consturctor yet because for this week's in-progress I will only show the two classic pizzas as an example.
> They are the classic cheese pizza and pepperoni pizza.
> For constructor parameters, I included variant, size, toppingCount, x and y coordinate, and rotation. I think it is enough for now.
> For next week, I'm thinking to do some randomization for topping count of each toppings used and randomization for the rotation of pizza.
> Pizza size will also be randomized to ensure diversity. I will draw much more variations of pizzas on canvas next week.
> I am also thinking to add some interactions to the canvas by implementing mousePressed(), second() function, keyboard inputs, mouseX and mouseY.
