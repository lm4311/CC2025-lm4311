# Assignment 3

> - I chose to do a tree ring digital clock because it represents the passage of time through the increase of growth rings
> I think this is a great idea because it captures the idea of time but also has a lot of room for me use my imagination
> Even though the tree ring digital clock does not show the exact time, it reveals the passage of time in years, months, days, and hours
> The growth rings here do not exactly follow natural rules as it will be a little abstract and creative. 
> Each thin ring represents one month and each thicker year ring represents one year, meaning that each year will consist of 12 rings (1 thick ring and 11 thin rings)
> Each thin ring will be animated through setting the end point of arc dynamically responding to day passing.
> Background color will also be changing dynamically based on the day-night cycle. 
> Users can click and hold the mouse button to speed up the time to see the passage of time more clearly.
> These animated and interactive features will be implemented in the next week's assignment as it directly contributes to the clock function.
> This week I purely focused on the aesthetics and appearance of the abstract digital clock
> There are four year rings for this tree ring digital clock, meaning that a full animated cycle of time passage will be four years.
> After each full cycle, the tree will change its shape by randomizing the width and height of itsrectangular barks and default tree rings back to 0 becuase it now becomes a new tree
> This feature will also be implemented next week as it relates to the clock function
