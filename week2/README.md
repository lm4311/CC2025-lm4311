# Week 2 notes

I added a few shapes within the circle including rectangle, quad, triangle, and even lines. I reaaranged them and placed them accordingly to where I thought the final pattern would look the best. I set the stroke width to a higher pixel to make the pattern look more solid and appealing. There was no exact reason for the placement of the shapes; I placed them based on my intuition and aesthetics.
