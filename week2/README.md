# Week 2 notes

## Updates

1. I added a few shapes within the circle including rectangle, quad, triangle, and even lines. I reaaranged them and placed them accordingly to where I thought the final pattern would look the best. I set the stroke width to a higher pixel to make the pattern look more solid and appealing. There was no exact reason for the placement of the shapes; I placed them based on my intuition and aesthetics. 

2. I created variables like the XY-coordinate for the shape pattern origin so that I could move the shape pattern as a whole easily just by tweaking the values from two variables. Thanks to the origin XY-coordinate variables, I implemented center stage functionality for my shape pattern so that it will always stay at the center of a window no matter the differences in window height and width.
